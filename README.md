🎬 Movie Recommendation System
📌 Project Overview

This project is a Movie Recommendation System developed as part of my internship project.
The system recommends movies to users based on similarity between movies using data analysis and machine learning techniques.

The goal of this project is to build a simple yet effective recommendation engine that suggests movies similar to the one selected by the user.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

NumPy

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

📂 Project Structure

Movie_Recommendation_System.ipynb   # Main project notebook
movies.csv                          # Dataset file
README.md                           # Project documentation

⚙️ How It Works

Load the movie dataset.

Perform data preprocessing (handling null values, selecting important columns).

Convert textual data into numerical vectors.

Calculate similarity between movies using cosine similarity.

Recommend top similar movies based on user input.
